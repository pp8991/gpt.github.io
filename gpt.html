	<p>Geophysical Technology aka GPT is a 5 year integrated M.Tech course offered in IIT Roorkee. One can take admission in GPT through jee only. It comes under the department of earth sciences. Now what is geophysics? basically Geophysics is all about using a number of physical tools like Gravity, Potential, Seismic, Magneti fields etc. to explain the phenomena and processes that take place at or near the surface of earth. enough of these geography stuffs, now lets get into history dude.  </p></div>

		<div>	<h1 style="text-align: center;"> GPT: a brief history</h1>
			<p>The geological studies in the university date back to the middle of the last century when Colonel Sir Proby Cautley (who was responsible for establishing the Thomason Engineering College) was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society, London, for his pioneering work on the vertebrate fossils of the Shivalik Ranges. Later Henry Benedict Medlicot, who was also admitted as the Fellow of the Royal Society in 1877, occupied the Chair in Geology and Experimental Sciences at Thomason College.</p></div>

<div><p>The Department of Earth Sciences, formerly the Department of Geology and Geophysical Technology, was established in 1960. During the span of six decades the department has become one of the foremost centres of research, post graduate training and consultancy in the field of Earth Sciences. The department has been recipient of financial aid under the prestigious Special Assistance and COSIST programmes of UGC (Ministry of Human Resources and development, Govt. of India).</p></div>

<div><p> now lets talk about why GPT is a great branch. </p></div>

<div><h1 style="text-align: center;"> GPT: CHILL HEY BRUH </h1></div>
<div><p><img style="float:right;width:320px;height:220px;" src="images/gpt chill.jpeg" alt="chill gpt"  ; border="5">
<div>	<p> GPT is a branch where u study cool things and u study less compared to other branches but still get great placements compared to other branches. GPT has less contact hours and u will get a good cg even if u study very less. U will get enough free time to learn new things. Still if u are not convinced ki gpt chill hey then lets see what are the basic requirments of a good college life vs what gpt offers u.</p></div>
<div><ul style="list-style-type:disc">
	<li>bunch of crazy friends- check</li>
	<li>less study- check</li>
	<li>high pacakage- check</li>
	<li>free time- check</li>
	<li>sexy campus life- check</li>
	<li>lots of hot bandiya- uncheck(iitian ho kuch to saram karlo)</li>
</ul></div>
<p> so all in all gpt offers u a life of a stud and a placement of a nerd. </p>

</p></div>
<h1 style="text-align: center;">Basic Difference Between GT-GPT</h1>
<p>A general doubt which engulfs the crowd is how different are the two branches, especially while filling choices during counselling procedure.</p>

<p>Both these branches share a fare number of courses every semester for they are both interlinked in their prospects, like two wheels of the same bicycle; one can’t function without the other. However, they are quite different at the elementary level. While Geological Technology deals solely with geology of earth and its elements, Geophysical Technology uses this information along with technical data obtained from various exploration techniques. On simpler terms, while a geologist tells you which location and geology is apt for finding oil, a geophysicist uses complex exploration techniques to provide petroleum engineers the exact location of oil.</p>

<p>Over the due course of 5 years, the branch Geophysical Technology takes you from elementary geology and basic exploration techniques to complex and more industry-relevant courses such as well logging and seismic methods of surveying.</p>
<h1 style="text-align: center;">GPT:Prospects and Placements</h1>
<p>Since the branch is specifically focused on geophysical techniques, the prospects are firstly a wide range of research in this field. This branch of earth sciences is evergreen and largely established in foreign countries, but here in India, the research has only just begun to grow in the past few decades. Due to this large prospect, many students pursue research in Earth sciences, even after receiving an engineering degree.</p>
<p>As far as companies and placements are concerned, there are several companies core that involve in campus placements. The branch  specializes in oil exploration and hence relevant companies follow. To name a few, Schlumburger Asia Services Ltd.,ONGC, Shell, HPCL, Coal India, Essar Group. There are only high paying jobs provided to this branch as this field requires lots of expertise and knowledge, and hence a higher average.</p>

<p>Apart from core companies, there are several non-core companies too which offer jobs to the students and a significant number too.(coding, finance, data science ,marketting etc.)

<h1 style="text-align: center;">Know Your Department</h1>
<p>Asan Bhasame Agar kisiko chill professors aur sexy dept. chahiye to aap ekdum sahi jageh aaye ho. </p>

<p>Basically the department of earth sciences provides ample instruments for enriching students with surveying techniques right in the department, those used by professionals all over the globe. Apart from these, the department sponsors regular field trips for its students across India to familiarize them with the much required proceedings that take place in the field by companies.</p>
